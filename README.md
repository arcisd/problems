# problems
Some programming problems:

001. Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number F_n.

002. Given an integer n, find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number F_n (that is, F_n mod 10).

003. Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

004. Given two integers a and b, find their least common multiple.

005. Given two integers n and m, output F_n mod m (that is, the remainder of F_n when divided by m).

006. The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value
(an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

007. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

008. The goal is, given two sequences a_1,a_2,...,a_n and b_1,b_2,...,b_n, find a permutation π of the second
sequence such that the dot product of a_1,a_2,...,a_n and b_{π_1},b_{π_2},...,b_{π_n} is minimum.

009. Given a set of n segments {[a_0,b_0],[a_1,b_1],...,[a_{n−1},b_{n−1}]} with integer coordinates on a line, find
the minimum number m of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a
set of integers X of the minimum size such that for any segment [a_i,b_i] there is a point x∈X such
that a_i≤x≤b_i.

010. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise
distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as
a_1+a_2+···+a_k where a_1,...,a_k are positive integers and a_i\neq a_j for all 1≤i<j≤k.
