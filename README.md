# problems
Some programming problems:

001. Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number F_n.

002. Given an integer n, find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number F_n (that is, F_n mod 10).

003. Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

004. Given two integers a and b, find their least common multiple.

005. Given two integers n and m, output F_n mod m (that is, the remainder of F_n when divided by m).

006. The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value (an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

007. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

008. The goal is, given two sequences a_1,a_2,...,a_n and b_1,b_2,...,b_n, find a permutation π of the second sequence such that the dot product of a_1,a_2,...,a_n and b_{π_1},b_{π_2},...,b_{π_n} is minimum.

009. Given a set of n segments {[a_0,b_0],[a_1,b_1],...,[a_{n−1},b_{n−1}]} with integer coordinates on a line, find the minimum number m of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a set of integers X of the minimum size such that for any segment [a_i,b_i] there is a point x∈X such that a_i≤x≤b_i.

010. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as a_1+a_2+···+a_k where a_1,...,a_k are positive integers and a_i\neq a_j for all 1≤i<j≤k.

011. The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.

012. The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element.

013. To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < x part, = x part, and > x part.

014. The goal in this problem is to count the number of inversions of a given sequence.

015. In this problem you are given a set of points on a line and a set of segments on a line. The goal is to compute, for each point, the number of segments that contain this point.

016. Given an integer n, compute the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n starting from the number 1.

017. In this problem, you are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible into your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

018. The goal of this problem is to implement the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings.

019. Find the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic operations using additional parentheses.

020. Given three sequences A=(a_1,a_2,...,a_n), B=(b_1,b_2,...,b_m), and C=(c_1,c_2,...,c_l), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer p such that there exist indices 1≤i_1<i_2<···<i_p≤n, 1≤j_1<j_2<···<j_p≤m, 1≤k_1<k_2<···<k_p≤l such that a_{i_1}=b_{j_1}=c_{k_1},...,a_{i_p}=b_{j_p}=c_{k_p}.
